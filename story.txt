It was a rainy day in Maidson, WI. Emik and his boy Lucas were not about to let the 
bunk weather kill the vibe though. Emik and Lucas set out an a epic quest to go to this
lit party that a little bird told them about. As Emik walks into the party he sees a familiar face,
but can't exactly tell who it is...

A face emerges out of the dark basement, and low and behold, it's Sammy! Emik recognized Sammy right away, but Sammy wasn't feeling the best, so it took him a few seconds to recongize his xteam boy. They had a good laugh and facetimed one of Emik's friends. Then Emik watched Sammy head back over the pong table.

Suddenly, another face emerges out of the dark basement. It took some time, but Emik realized who it was. It was Dineth! Dineth reminded Emik that they had an X-team 
project due by midnight. So from there, they got Sammy to tag along to work on the assignment. They pulled up a laptop over the pong table, but then they realized that something felt off.
